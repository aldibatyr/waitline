# Waitline App

## About

Waitline app was created by Aldiyar Batyrbekov to showcase use of React and Material UI knowledge.

The application has capabilities of registering user, logging user in and adding guests to the wait line.

## Use

Simply register and login to the app. Add guests clicking or tapping the button at the bottom of the screen. This will open up a form that lets you add information about the guest. </br>

Guest "Cards" will be displayed on main page. The cards are expandable to handle confirmation, deletion of the guest. Expanded view also allows user to edit guest information at any given time.

Without further ado, click on the link down below and give it a try.

P.S. The app is in early stages still and constantly worked on. </br>
